      <h2>UST Museum exhibit features ‘adult coloring books’; stresses power of 

colors</h2>
      <p>

Delving in a new exploration that teaches and communicates the value of arts to 

the public, the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Museum features works from 

“adult coloring books” in a month-long exhibit.</p>

<p>Titled “Color More, Stress Less,” the exhibition seeks to emphasize the 

importance of colors and coloring in this seemingly stressful time. It opened last 

April 11 and will run until May 6, 2016 at the UST Museum, España, Manila.

“The UST Museum displays works not just to showcase but to share knowledge 

and experiences along the line of arts and culture,” UST Museum Director Fr. 

Isidro Abaño, O.P. said.</p>

<p>The previous year showed the phenomenon of interest in coloring books for 

adults with more people working on intricate illustrations using colored pencils 

and pens as materials.</p>

<p>“To better convey our message to the public, we might as well use what is 

already available and understandable to the present audience,” Fr. Abaño said. 

“Communication is two ways—giving and receiving. Now, many people are 

interested about coloring books because of its sudden popularity. So if you do 

something like this exhibit, you are already a step closer to communicating with 

them.”</p>

<p>Displayed in the exhibit were works by members of the group Coloring Book for 

Adult Philippines, which include Gilda Loja, Cathy Lasam-Ballo, Vermailene 

Barrios, Jacqueline Simpao-Callanta, Celeste Lecaroz-Aceron, Mike Torres, Red 

de Leon, Christian de Jesus, Ayn Descalsote, Ana Lourdes Aceron, Melissa 

Bautista-Paras, and Bianca Paras.</p>

<h3>Colors and the body</h3>

<p>According to Fr. Abaño, who is a colorist himself, coloring affects one’s psyche 

and gives an experience of lessening the stresses in life because it is enjoyable.

This was expounded in two lecture-conferences held last March 12 at the Civil 

Law Auditorium, where UST Department of Psychology chair Prof. Ma. Claudette 

Agnes, Ph.D., talked about the “Psychology of Colors.” She is also the chair of 

the Commission on Higher Education Technical Committee of Psychology. 

Meanwhile, Prof. Grace Brillantes-Evangelista, Ph.D., chair of the Psychological 

Association of the Philippines Clinical Division, lectured on “Embracing Well-

being through Arts.”</p>

<p>“Life today seems to be more complicated. They say technology is supposed to 

help us but technology has in a way made life a little bit stressful. That is why, 

perhaps, many engage in this activity. The repetitive strokes of the hand while 

coloring offer a relaxing and calming effect. It is in a way hypnotic,” Fr. Abaño 

said.</p>

<p>Fr. Abaño added that adult coloring books became appealing to many, especially 

to non-professional artists, because of the absence of pressure as to deadline, 

the choice of subject, and coloring techniques.</p>

<p>“Whenever I travel, I bring with me a small bag of coloring materials and a 

coloring book. When the flight is delayed, which is more often than not, or while 

in the airplane or train, you hardly notice the time. Coloring can be a way of 

passing time enjoyably and avoiding the manifestations of stress coming out of 

you,” he said.</p>

<h3>Colors and cultures</h3>

<p>Since time immemorial, people have considered colors to have a spectrum of 

cultural and religious symbolisms. Colors have affected peoples’ perspectives in 

their daily living.</p>

<p>“Look at the Buddhist sarong. It is orange because it exemplifies meditative 

awareness and spiritual enlightenment,” Fr. Abaño said. He mentioned that 

golden yellow, the color of the Vatican and UST, epitomizes the brightness of 

divinity and is “meant for God.”</p>

<p>Colors are also assistive in carrying out processes like how bright colors hasten 

the recovery of the sick and in the case of Fr. Abaño, colors aid him in prayer.

“When I worked on the image of the Virgin Mary, every time I placed a dot, I 

prayed for somebody. If the Rosary has beads to aid the devout, I considered the 

dots in the artwork in the same way,” Fr. Abaño said.</p>

<p>Helping people gain peace and share experiences of joy were Fr. Abaño’s 

personal objectives in putting up the exhibit, saying that “If I have something like 

this that brings good, you might as well try it and maybe it will also be good for 

you.”</p>

<p>“Whatever joyful experiences one attains from this simple activity can possibly be 

shared to others. I hope we can send this message to many,” Fr. Abaño 

said.#Alexis Ailex C. Villamor, Jr.</p>

    <label for="option2">UST, St. Mary’s University, London forge partnership</label>
    <article>
      <h2>UST, St. Mary’s University, London forge partnership</h2>
      

<p>As a step towards establishing stronger ties and further amplifying its 

internationalization thrust, the University of Santo inked its 114th Memorandum 

of Understanding (MOU) this time with St. Mary’s University (SMU), 

Twickenham, London, the oldest Catholic university in the United Kingdom.  

With Dr. Francis Campbell, Vice Chancellor representing SMU, and Rev. Fr. 

Richard G. Ang, O.P., Acting Rector representing UST, the signing of the 

MOU recognized UST as SMU’s essential partner in the Asia-Pacific Region 

rendering it as one of its six global partners. </p>

<p>UST Office of International Relations and Programs Director Prof. Lilian J. 

Sison, Ph.D. and SMU Head of Partnerships and Global Enterprise Dr. David 

Reggio served as witnesses.</p> 

<h3>The Church and State Relationship</h3>

<p>Prior to the MOU signing, Campbell delivered a lecture underscoring the 

persistent necessity to affiliate the social teachings of the Catholic Church 

with the demands of the present society. The lecture, “The Church and the 

Modern World”, was the second in the Diplomats’ Lecture Series of the 

University of Santo Tomas.</p>  

<p>Campbell upheld that “faith is a central dimension of the state” rendering it as 

a groundwork for the ethical and political dimensions of the state in all of its 

endeavors. He also stressed the notion that a “ruptured relationship between 

faith, reason, and society” can result to a chaotic society leading to a drying 

up of solidarity, cultural relativism and healthy secularism. </p>

<p>In highlighting religion instilled with a public role, Campbell also espoused that 

the growing religious complexities prompted by the church and state relation 

can only be solved through the privatization of religion.</p> 

<p>For Campbell, faith is reflected not just in the Church but also throughout the 

social order. It is in the society where one can find the collective signs of an 

animated faith — signs that at once can alter the grander social order and 

also support the individual and distinctive growth in virtue and devoutness.  

In his lecture, Campbell also discussed the fitting approach to faith. He 

emphasized that “faith is a product of various historical contexts and 

philosophical underpinnings.”</p>

<p>In acknowledging the multiplicity of religion, Campbell argued that religion 

must be viewed within the context and lenses of a pluralist methodology, as it 

is imbued with a “respected distinctiveness”, where faiths can engage in 

different autonomies upholding equilibrium in the society and provide 

solutions to contemporary cultures and democracy. </p>

<h3>An Avenue for Cross-Cultural Experiences</h3> 

<p>During the press conference that followed the lecture and MOU signing, UST 

Office of International Relations and Programs Director Prof. Lilian J. Sison, 

Ph.D. commended the partnership with SMU as it will truly fortify the 

internationalization thrust of UST and students will be greatly exposed to the 

global environment. </p>

<p>“We welcome this partnership with St. Mary’s University because it will be 

another destination of our students,” she added. </p>

<p>In support of what Sison mentioned, Campbell also said that his long-term 

goal in this partnership is that of an exchange because it is in the exchange 

where an educational and cultural transfer can transpire. </p>

<p>"It comes with the history of institutions. We approach education in different 

ways but our common ground is the Catholic university network," Campbell 

said. He emphasized that the partnership is also a great means of showing 

how religion can engage the public sphere. </p>

<p>Through the said alliance, the SMU leader also said that the two Catholic 

universities, with religion as their springboard in achieving their goals, would 

be able to break the notion of religion as an element that is situated in the 

periphery effecting pluralism. </p>

<p>Campbell ended by accentuating that the partnership is a great opportunity for 

the Catholic identity to go back to its roots and foundations, for the enrichment 

of relationships, academic and cultural exchange, inciting camaraderie and 

unity for the two oldest Catholic Universities in the globe.</p>

    <label for="option3">US Ambassador to PH headlines UST’s 3rd Diplomats’ Lecture Series</label>
    <article>
      <h2>US Ambassador to PH headlines UST’s 3rd Diplomats’ Lecture Series</h2>
      

<p>Centering on the privileges and opportunities afforded by a career in diplomacy and 

foreign service, United States (US) Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg 

shared his experiences and functions as a diplomat during the University of Santo 

Tomas’ (UST) 3rd Diplomats’ Lecture Series last April 27 at the Paredes Bldg., UST, 

Manila.</p>

<p>“One of the functions of foreign service is political diplomatic representation. Thus, 

wherever you are posted, you are responsible for representing the United States in 

various issues that would touch on the US and its relationship with the Philippines,” 

Ambassador Goldberg said.</p>

<p>According to the American diplomat, there are two trainings involved when preparing for 

diplomatic services—formal, which involves studying subjects “needed as one goes 

abroad” like international relations, history, and languages.</p>

<p>“Another is informal training. You need interest and curiosity in what’s going on in the 

world. You have to read newspapers and magazines,” said the Ambassador, who 

studied journalism in college.</p>

<p>As the US President’s official envoy to the country, Ambassador Goldberg said that in 

addition to the political aspects of his work, his position requires a myriad of other 

functions that delve on economic policy, public affairs, and even human resource 

management.</p>

<p>Understanding your own country and what your country and people aspire for are key 

factors in effectively understanding one’s role and representing the nation overseas, 

Ambassador Goldberg stressed.</p>

<p>Prior to his appointment to the Philippines in 2013, Ambassador Goldberg served as 

Assistant Secretary of the State for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research and was 

concurrently the Coordinator for Implementation of UNSC Resolution 1874 in North 

Ambassador Goldberg also served as Ambassador to Bolivia from 2006 to 2008, Chief 

of Mission in Pristina, Kosovo from 2004 to 2006, and Deputy Chief of Mission at the US 

Embassy in Santiago, Chile from 2001 to 2004.</p>

<p>When he was assigned as political-economic officer in Pretoria, South Africa to help 

prepare the country for democracy, Ambassador Goldberg shared that he was “lucky to 

have entered at a time when Nelson Mandela was coming in.” 

"Over time, you have to accumulate knowledge that touch on different areas. As in other 

professions, you continuously learn more,” Ambassador Goldberg said.</p>

<h3>UST and the US</h3>

<p>Ambassador Goldberg said that UST and the US had important historical ties, which was 

forged during the Second World War.</p>

<p>“UST also has a very special place for us at the US Embassy and in the history of PH-

US relations. People keep coming back to UST. In fact, in my office, I have a picture of 

the Americans being liberated here at Santo Tomas. So many of the relationships that 

were forged during that time remain today,” Ambassador Goldberg said. </p>

<p>The Ambassador added, “this university is older than any university I know of in the US, 

and this has a very special place in the pantheon of universities around the world.”

Following the Ambassador’s lecture were questions from a panel of reactors composed 

of UST Graduate School Dean Marilu Madrunio, Faculty of Civil Law faculty member 

Atty. Enrique de la Cruz, and Faculty of Arts and Letters Student Council president Jan 

Dominic Castro.</p>

<p>Questions from students and faculty members in the audience were also entertained.

UST Acting Rector Rev. Fr. Richard G. Ang, O.P. closed the gathering with hopes for 

deeper links between the University and the US Embassy in Manila.</p>

<p>“The partnerships UST has forged with American institutions have paved the way to 

many educational ties, various academic and cultural exchanges, sharing of best 

practices, active learning opportunities, and genuine friendship,” Fr. Ang said. “UST is 

committed to furthering these things and continue to aim for a stronger collaborative 

endeavors and dynamic cooperation.”</p>


<p>An artwork called “Fusion,” which was specially commissioned for the lecture series and 

made by internationally renowned artist Joe Datuin, was given to the Ambassador.

The UST Diplomats’ Lecture Series was born in 2015 with the Deputy Head of Mission 

of the Embassy of France as inaugural speaker. The 2nd Diplomats’ Lecture Series, 

meanwhile, featured the Vice Chancellor of St. Mary’s University in London.#AV</p>
